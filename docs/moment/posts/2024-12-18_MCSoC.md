# Two Papers by Undergraduate Students to Be Presented at MCSoC 2024 in Kuala Lumpur  

We are excited to announce that two of our papers will be presented at the 2024 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSoC), taking place from December 16–19, 2024, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

## 1. EnsembleSTDP: Distributed In-situ Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity Learning in Spiking Neural Networks  
Authors: Yuga Hanyu and Khanh N. Dang  

This paper introduces EnsembleSTDP, a distributed in-situ learning mechanism for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). The method leverages Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) to enable efficient, unsupervised online learning. EnsembleSTDP aims to enhance training speed and scalability, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementations.  

**Yuga Hanyu さん**, a 4th-year undergraduate student, will present this work. He has done an excellent job contributing to the research and preparing for this presentation.  

## 2. Energy-Efficient Spiking Neural Networks Using Approximate Neuron Circuits and 3D Stacking Memory  
Authors: Ryoji Kobayashi, Ngo-Doanh Nguyen, Nguyen Anh Vu Doan, and Khanh N. Dang  

This paper proposes an energy-efficient approach to Spiking Neural Networks by combining approximate neuron circuits with 3D stacking memory. The research focuses on reducing power consumption while maintaining high performance, offering promising solutions for low-power neuromorphic computing applications.  

**Ryoji Kobayashi さん**, also a 4th-year undergraduate student, will present this work. This is his second paper and presentation at an IEEE conference, demonstrating his growing expertise and commitment to advancing neuromorphic computing research.
