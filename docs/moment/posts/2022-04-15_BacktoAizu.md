# New Chapter: Returning to the University of Aizu

I’m happy to share that I’ve returned to the University of Aizu as an Associate Professor. Having been part of this community before, it’s nice to come back and take on a new role.

This is not just a new chapter for me but also for my family. I’m especially thankful to my wife for her support and encouragement throughout this journey. We’re both looking forward to settling in and exploring what lies ahead.

The University of Aizu has always been a place I’ve admired for its focus on innovation and collaboration. I’m excited to start teaching, mentoring, and continuing research that I hope will make a difference. I’m also looking forward to reuniting with the Adaptive Systems Laboratory, where I had many valuable experiences in the past and where I hope to contribute further in the future.

At the same time, I want to express my gratitude to the VNU University of Engineering and Technology, where I had the chance to grow both personally and professionally. A special thank you goes to the Key Laboratory of Smart Integrated Systems (SISLAB). My time at SISLAB was filled with rewarding collaborations, meaningful projects, and friendships that I will always value. I’ll carry the lessons and memories from SISLAB with me as I move forward.

As part of getting settled, I took a moment to visit Tsuruga-jo. It’s a beautiful spot that reflects the history and culture of the region, and it felt like the right place to pause and reflect on this new beginning.
