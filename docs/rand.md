# Random 

Just some random things about me. Not related to work :).
{: .announce}

## Chess

I am an avid chess fan. My chess.com rapid rating is 1400-ish (it is a bit low, I know :D). My favorite opening as white is English and as black is Sicilian Defence (hyperaccelerated dragon variation). I also like to play Benko Gambit against 1.d4. If you want to play, please let me know :D.

## Football

I am also a football fan and play almost weekly at the University's playground. Please join if you are interested. I am personally not a good player but I do enjoy playing.


## Analog Film

I enjoy analog films sometimes.
