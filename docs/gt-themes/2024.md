## Flow for Graduation

![GT flow](GT-flow.svg "GT flow")


## Laboratory Guidelines

1. Our group consists of 2 Master students and 7 undergraduate students (see [Group Members](../grp_mem.html)).
2. Group meeting: twice a month (1st and 3rd week).
3. Face-to-face meeting with each student: twice a month (2nd and 4th week). This meeting can be flexible depending on the progress.
4. Lab meeting: twice a week.
5. From 4th year, you need to make presentations to report on working progress.
6. For excellent students, paper submissions and traveling for conferences (in Japan or abroad) are strongly recommended.

  ## What can you learn from the GT project

0. We have dedicated schedules and a well-managing system that can be adapted to different levels and styles of students. The professor is also very accessible and open to discussion. The lab environment is very friendly.
1. An English-speaking environment in which you can practice your English. We also have both Japanese students and international students (see [Group Members](../grp_mem.html))!
2. Working on actual prototypes and learning from them. (see [some sample projects by students here](../memtor.html))!
3. Learn how to make slides, how to present, how to answer questions, and how to write reports.
4. **For excellent students, you will learn how to write a paper, travel abroad, and present**. See [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10616602) for an example of a B4 student's paper.

   
## Topics
### Power-Efficient Spiking Neural Network

This project aims to research and implement an adaptive, low-power spiking neural network system in hardware (NASH) based on our earlier-developed OASIS communication network. NASH implements the following features (1) an efficient adaptive configuration method that enables reconfiguration of different SNN parameters (spike weights, routing, hidden layers, topology, etc.), (2) a mixture of different deep NN topologies, (3) an efficient fault-tolerant multicast spike routing algorithm, (4) Efficient on-chip learning mechanism. To demonstrate the performance of the NASH system, an FPGA implementation shall be developed and  a VLSI implementation shall also be established.


Students can work on software (Python), or hardware (VLSI/FPGA) or both.

#### Demonstration of previous design

### Low-power Generative Adversarial Network

A low-power Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is an energy-efficient version of a traditional GAN, optimized for environments with limited computational resources. By using techniques like model compression and approximate computing, it reduces energy consumption, enabling real-time data generation on low-power devices like smartphones, IoT systems, and neuromorphic hardware.

In this project, you will design a baseline  Generative Adversarial Network in Pytorch or Verilog HDL and reduce the power consumption using our own previously designed techniques such as approximate computing, approximate memory, or data compression

Students can work on software (Python), or hardware (VLSI/FPGA) or both.


### "Green" AI Computing (You can pick your AI application)
