Follow these simple steps to create a strong research plan:

## 1. Learn About Our Research
Before you start writing, ==take time to read about our previous research [projects](research.md) and [publications](pub.md)==. This will help you:  

- Understand what topics we focus on.  
- Find ways to connect your research idea with what we’ve already done.  
- Show how your work will add to or expand our research.

## 2. Clearly Explain Your Research Purpose
Begin your plan by clearly explaining what you want to research:  

- What problem are you trying to solve?  
- Why is this problem important?  
- What are the main goals of your research?  

Make sure your explanation is easy to understand.

## 3. Give an Overview of the Current Research
Provide a short review of the research already done in your area:  

- What are the key ideas and important findings?  
- What gaps or problems still need to be solved?  
- How will your research fill these gaps or improve on the existing work?  
- Mention how your research could help solve a local or global problem.

## 4. Describe Your Research Plan

Explain how you will carry out your research. Include:  
- The methods or experiments you will use.  
- The tools or resources you need.  
- ==**Illustrations or diagrams**== of your plan, especially if it is difficult to explain in words.  
- A timeline showing key steps and when you expect to complete them.  
- A ==**detailed schedule**== with specific tasks and deadlines.  
- Any challenges you might face and how you plan to overcome them.

## 5. Highlight the Impact of Your Research
Show why your research is important:  

- How will it help the community, industry, or society?  
- How does it fit with our institution’s goals?  
- Could it lead to partnerships or collaborations?

## 6. Keep It Simple and Well-Organized
Make sure your research plan is:  

- Easy to read with clear sections and headings.  
- Free of complex words or unnecessary details.  
- Short and to the point (2-3 pages is ideal).

By following these steps, you’ll create a research plan that is clear, relevant, and shows your potential to make a valuable contribution.
