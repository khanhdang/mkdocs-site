# Open SW/HW

## Hardware

### Fully-connected Spiking Neural Network on FPGA

- **Description**: An open-source FPGA implementation of a fully-connected SNN on FPGA
- **Link**: to be released.

## Software

### Ensemble Distributed STDP Learning

- **Description**: In this project, we proposed a novel approach for distributed STDP learning using multiple sub-models. The sub-models are later merged and compressed at the centralized server.
- **Link**: [Github](https://github.com/klab-aizu/EnsembleSTDP)
- **Paper**: [Hanyu Yuga and Khanh N. Dang, *"EnsembleSTDP: Distributed in-situ Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity Learning in Spiking Neural Networks"*,  2024 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore*Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSoC), Dec. 16-19, 2024.

### SNN Ternary Weight Training

- **Description**: In this project, we ternary the weight (to the format of \[-A, 0 or A\], A is a fixed value) of a deep spiking neural network.
