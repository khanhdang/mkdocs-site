# Welcome! ようこそ！ Xin chào! Bonjour!

![Image title](./assets/images/Khanh_N_DANG.jpg){class="avatar"}
Hello! My name is Khanh N. Dang (in Vietnamese: Đặng Nam Khánh, in Japanese: ダン ナム カイン).

I am currently an **Associate Professor** in the Division of Computer Engineering, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [The University of Aizu](https://www.u-aizu.ac.jp/en/). I earned my Ph.D. from [The University of Aizu](https://www.u-aizu.ac.jp/en/) and my M.Sc. from [Paris XI University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Sud_University) (now [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en)). Prior to joining the University of Aizu, I worked at [Vietnam National University, Hanoi](https://vnu.edu.vn/eng/) and [Dolphin-IC](https://www.dolphin-ic.com/).

**Research Interests:** My current research covers three key topics: *(1) carbon-efficient computing*, *(2) 3D-IC technology*, and *(3) neuromorphic computing*. I am particularly interested in advancing computing architectures that achieve ultra-low-power and scalable solutions suitable for safe, responsible real-world deployment.


!!! success "Prospective Students"
        Research opportunities in VLSI design, carbon-efficient computing, and neuromorphic computing are available for GT undergraduate and graduate students. Interested candidates are encouraged to email their **resume**, **transcript**, and a **brief statement** explaining their interest in joining our group. 

!!! warning "Note" 
        Due to the high volume of emails, I may not respond if your research interests do not align closely with mine or if the required documents are not attached.
