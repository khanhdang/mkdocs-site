!!! success "About the projects" 
    I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work with several talented students. The projects listed below were created by these students, with my role being that of a guide.


## In-Class Projects

!!! tip ""
    This class follows the "project-based learning" principle by letting the students explore and design their own idea.

### Course: Real-time Gaming Systems
This project involves designing a simple game on a Xilinx Artix-7 (AC701) board using dual-core MicroBlaze processors, where one core controls HDMI output, and the other manages and renders the game. The game logic is implemented with FreeRTOS.

Our students won the 1st prize at the SEACAS 2019 Hackathon with the "Magic Spoon" project, a prototype designed to stabilize hand tremors commonly experienced by Parkinson's patients. Unlike conventional PID control, this project utilized a single-layer perceptron to control a servo motor, and included a database and Android application for diagnosis and treatment suggestions.

Our team also participated in the IEEE CASS Student Design Competition, held as part of ISCAS 2020 in Seville, Spain, with both in-person and online attendance due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
