# Student Projects

!!! note 
        I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work with several talented students. The projects listed below were created by these students, with my role being that of a guide.

## Class Project

### Course: Real-time Gaming Systems
This project involves designing a simple game on an Artix-7 (AC701) board using dual-core MicroBlaze processors, where one core controls HDMI output, and the other manages and renders the game. The game logic is implemented with FreeRTOS.

## Student Design and Research Contributions

### Approximate Izhikevich Neuron Model

In this project, a fourth-year (B4) student employed Approximate Computing to balance computational accuracy with hardware efficiency. Rather than simply using approximate adders and multipliers in the Izhikevich neuron model, this work explores a variety of combinations of these components, utilizing an approximation-aware approach.

Our students won the 1st prize at the SEACAS 2019 Hackathon with the "Magic Spoon" project, a prototype designed to stabilize hand tremors commonly experienced by Parkinson's patients. Unlike conventional PID control, this project utilized a single-layer perceptron to control a servo motor, and included a database and Android application for diagnosis and treatment suggestions.

Our team also participated in the IEEE CASS Student Design Competition, held as part of ISCAS 2020 in Seville, Spain, with both in-person and online attendance due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
