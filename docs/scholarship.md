!!! note "Eligibility"  
    - This page is mainly for international students. I am not familiar with scholarships for Japanese students. Please contact the university for more information regarding domestic scholarships.
    - These are two common scholarships, there are different ones such as JASSO or SAISUA.
 

## **MEXT Scholarship**  
The **MEXT (Monbukagakusho) Scholarship** is a prestigious scholarship offered by the Japanese government, covering tuition, a monthly stipend, and travel expenses.

     - Your research interests do not align with mine
     - You are unsure about pursuing a Ph.D.
