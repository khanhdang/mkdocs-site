!!! note "Eligibility"  
    - This page is mainly for international students. I am not familiar with scholarships for Japanese students. Please contact the university for more information regarding domestic scholarships.
    - These are two common scholarships, there are different ones such as JASSO or SAISUA.
 

## **MEXT Scholarship**  
The **MEXT (Monbukagakusho) Scholarship** is a prestigious scholarship offered by the Japanese government, covering tuition, a monthly stipend, and travel expenses.

!!! warning "Notice"
     Please do not email me about the MEXT scholarship if:

     - Your GPA is below 3.1/4.0 or 2.3/3.0.
     - You do not have an English or Japanese proficiency certificate. 
     - You do not have a publication in an ACM/IEEE conference (for Master candidate) or a Scopus-indexed (Q1 or Q2) journal (for Ph.D. candidate) .
     - Your research interests do not align with mine. My main research is computer hardware and I will not accept any MEXT candidate in software.
     - You are unsure about pursuing a Ph.D (for Master candidate).
     - You are unsure about your commitment to joining if awarded the scholarship.
     - If you plan to submit to other universities'  scholarships.
     
     Due to the high volume of emails, I will not be able to reply to inquiries that do not meet the requirements.
